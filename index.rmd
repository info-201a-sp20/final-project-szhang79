## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Bar Graph

This is a function that returns 4 bar graphs using the given dataframe and compares the average budget to the year, grouped by rating.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(budget_bar_graph(movies))
```

The four charts compares the relationship of how the budget of each type of rating category changes throughout the span of 30 years. Using a bar graph, wrapped into separate rating categories, we are able to see that, besides the rated R category, all the categories increase the budget of the movies throughout the years. We are also able to see that the rated G movie productions have a trend of acquiring a higher budget compared to the other rating categories.
