## Introduction



#### Summary Information 
  In our Movies dataset, there are `r number_of_cols` columns. The character types for each column are: `r char_types`. There are `r number_of_rows` rows. These are 10 unique values from the movie names column: `r example_movies`. 



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
